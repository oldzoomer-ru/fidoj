## AI-generated code and AI tools notice

I use AI tools only for autocomplete code and for generating MVP (Minimum Viable Product) code.
Also, I use AI tools for generating documentation, tests, and other routine tasks.

Initially I used AI tools for generating whole projects, but I stopped doing this
after I realized that AI-generated code is not good enough for my needs. Quality
of AI-generated code **is not good** enough for my needs, and it **is not good enough for my projects**.

Refactoring and improvements are mainly made by me. I rarely use AI tools for refactoring and improvements.

This text is autocompleted (not generated fully) by AI tool, but this is fully my opinion,
not AI opinion. I am responsible for this text, not AI tool.
